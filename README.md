 - (in "templates") web.html: AI model quick request
 - .gitattributes: git requirement
 - Authentication.txt: placeholder for original authentication codes, removed due to obvious reasons
 - Bed_Allocation.py: Bed code creation
 - Beds_with_List.spec: Connection to database
 - Data.csv: Test data
 - app.py: Connection to quick request
 - beddiag.bat & bedregister.bat: Shortcuts for testing purposes
 - clf.pkl: Pickled model
 - greedy-alg.py: Greedy algorithm

 - site_link.txt: Link to site

A few things to note:
- The greedy algorithm works, but requires a specialized hardware that we do not have
- The program still works without the greedy algorithm
- The program will not function unless you are registered as this is built for hospitals so it is currently not possible to use by downloading the files
- A intro video and the demonstation is in the DevFolio
